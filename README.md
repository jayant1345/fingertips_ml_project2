# 🧠 Fingertips Classification Project

This repository contains a machine learning classification project using public health data sourced from Fingertips (UK Public Health Profiles). The objective is to perform classification analysis and evaluate different models for predictive performance.

## 📁 Project Structure

## 📊 Project Description

The project involves:

- Data exploration and cleaning
- Feature engineering
- Model building using classifiers like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.
- Model evaluation using classification metrics
- Visualization of performance results

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- NumPy

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/fingertips-classification.git
cd fingertips-classification

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate



```

pip install -r requirements.txt
pip freeze > requirements.txt

jupyter notebook fingertips_project2_classification.ipynb

✅ Results
Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix

Insights from feature importance or model interpretability tools (if included)

📌 Notes
Data preprocessing steps are crucial and are performed before modeling.

Model performance may vary based on dataset size, balance, and feature selection.
